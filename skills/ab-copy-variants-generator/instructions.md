# A/B Copy Variants Generator

Generate 5 distinct, testable copy variants for any marketing element. Each variant tests exactly ONE conversion lever so the test produces an actionable insight — not just "different wording."

## Conversion Levers Tested

| Lever | What It Tests |
|---|---|
| `Emotion` | Fear vs. desire vs. curiosity vs. social proof |
| `Specificity` | Vague benefit vs. specific number/outcome |
| `Voice` | Brand-driven vs. customer-language |
| `Urgency` | Time pressure vs. opportunity framing |
| `Anchor` | What reference point shapes the reader's perception |

## Elements This Skill Handles

- Email subject lines
- Email preview text
- Landing page headlines
- CTA button text
- Ad headlines (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)
- Ad body copy
- Social post openings
- Hero section subheadlines
- Pricing page tier names

## Process

```
1. IDENTIFY -> The element to test + primary conversion goal (click/open/reply/purchase)
2. AUDIENCE -> Identify the target audience segment
3. GENERATE -> 5 variants, each testing a different lever
4. ANNOTATE -> Each variant gets: copy + lever name + hypothesis ("This will outperform because...")
5. SAMPLE   -> Recommend minimum sample size for statistical validity
6. BET      -> Flag the variant I'd bet on and explain why
```

## Output Format Per Variant

```
**Variant [A-E] — [Lever Name]**
Copy: "[The actual copy]"
Hypothesis: This will outperform the control because [specific reason].
```

## How to Trigger

```
"Generate A/B variants for this [element]. Goal: [conversion goal]. Audience: [description]."
```

## Example

**Input**: "Subject line for a cold email to e-commerce founders. Goal: open rate. Current: 'Automate your customer support with AI'"

**Output**:

```
Variant A — Emotion (Curiosity)
Copy: "Your support team is answering the same 8 questions daily"
Hypothesis: Specific pain point beats vague benefit — will outperform because it reflects their reality.

Variant B — Specificity
Copy: "How [Brand] cut support tickets 62% in 3 weeks"
Hypothesis: Specific results + timeframe outperforms generic benefit claims.

Variant C — Voice (Customer Language)
Copy: "Tired of copy-pasting the same replies?"
Hypothesis: Mirrors the internal monologue of a frustrated founder — feels like it was written for them.

Variant D — Urgency (Opportunity)
Copy: "Your competitors are already doing this"
Hypothesis: FOMO framing activates loss aversion, a stronger motivator than gain.

Variant E — Anchor
Copy: "Hire a support agent for $0/month"
Hypothesis: Anchoring to "hiring" reframes cost perception — the tool feels like a bargain by comparison.

🎯 Bet: Variant B — Specificity. Numbers + timeframes build credibility before the email is even opened.
Minimum sample size: 1,000 sends per variant for 95% confidence.
```

## Rules

- Each variant must test ONE lever only — no hybrid variants
- Variants are not "tones" — they test meaningfully different psychological mechanisms
- Always state a falsifiable hypothesis
- Never generate "safe" variants — if it wouldn't change behavior, it's not worth testing
